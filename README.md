# First-Try-at-neural-Network
Implementation of a 3 layer neural network from scratch (just using numpy and my understanding of how everything works) trained on the MNIST dataset to identify drawing of numbers 0 - 9.
As of now i am getting about 95% accuracy 

# How to use this
1. Download the MNIST dataset from ~~http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/~~ (this no longer works on chrome download instead from this repo instead
2. Run ```py main.py``` and it will automatically start training on the dataset.
